{"type":"morphism adjective","name":"syntomic","description":"A morphism $f : X \\to Y$ of schemes is syntomic at $x \\in X$ if there exists an affine open neighborhood $U = \\Spec A \\subset X$ of $x$ and an affine open $V = \\Spec B \\subset Y$ with $f(U) \\subset V$ such that the induced ring morphism $B \\to A$ is syntomic, i.e. of finite presentation, makes $A$ into a flat $B$-module, and all the fiber rings $A \\otimes_B \\kappa(\\mathfrak{p})$ are local complete intersections. The morphism $f$ is syntomic if it is syntomic at each $x \\in X$."}
