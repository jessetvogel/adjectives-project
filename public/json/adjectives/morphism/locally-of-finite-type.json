{"type":"morphism adjective","name":"locally of finite type","description":"A morphism $f : X \\to Y$ of schemes is of finite type at $x \\in X$ if there exist affine opens $U = \\Spec A \\subset X$ containing $x$ and $V = \\Spec B \\subset Y$ with $f(U) \\subset V$ such that $A$ is a finitely generated $B$-algebra via the induced map $B \to A$. The morphism $f$ is locally of finite type if it is of finite type at each $x \\in X$."}
