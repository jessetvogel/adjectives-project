It can be constructed as follows. For any $n \\in \\NN$ let $X_n = \\AA^1_\\QQ$, and let $X_{ij} = X_i \\setminus \\{ i, j \\}$ for all $i, j \\in \\NN$. The transition maps $\\varphi_{ij} : X_{ij} \\to X_{ji}$ are the identity maps, obviously satisfying the cocycle conditions. The scheme is obtained by gluing."}
